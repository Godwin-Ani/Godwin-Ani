### Hi, I’m Godwin, it's nice to meet you.


- ❤ I love biology and Computers, and lose track of time when I'm reading or coding.


-  🌱 I'm always eager to grow and learn new things.


- 🗣🐍I speak Python cause what other language should a zoologist speak???


### What I'm focusing on 💯
- Research, research, and still more research.
- Solving all those research problems with computational skills.
- My PhD in the nearest future.
- Machine learning and omics data analysis.
- My back-end skills with django.


- and smile, you're beautiful☺.
