### Hi, I’m Godwin, it's nice to meet you.


- ❤ I love biology and Computers.

- 😍 I lose track of time when I'm reading or coding.
-  🌱 I'm always trying to grow and learn new things.


- 🗣I speak three languages. English cause it's my country official language, R cause it's a necessity in data science, and Python cause what other language should a zoologist speak???
- 💪😅 I hope to win a kaggle competition one day.

### What I'm focusing on 💯
- Research, and I hope to start my Ph.D in the nearest future.
- Learning as much as possible on omics data analysis.
- Currently improving my back-end skills in django.
- How to get married with Computational biology is a 9 and someday I hope to become the 1 it needs.
- 📫 you can reach me at aniigodwinn@gmail.com
