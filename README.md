- 👋 Hi, I’m @Godwin-Ani, it's nice to meet you.
- 🗣I speak three languages. English cause it's my country official language, R cause it's a necessity in data science, and Python cause what other language should a zoologist speak???😜
- I'm always trying to grow and learn new things.
- I lose track of time when I'm reading or coding.
- I hope to win a kaggle competition one day.
- 💪 Just began my machine learning journey.
- 👬 Always open for collaborations.
- ❤Computational biology is a 9 and someday I hope to become the 1 it needs.
- 📫 you can reach me at aniigodwinn@gmail.com
