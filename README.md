### Hi, I’m Godwin, it's nice to meet you.


- ❤ I love biology and Computers, and lose track of time when reading or coding.


-  🌱 I'm always eager to grow and learn new things.


- 🗣I speak three languages. English cause it's my country official language, R cause it's a necessity in data science, and Python cause what other language should a zoologist speak???
- 💪😅 I hope to win a kaggle competition one day.

### What I'm focusing on 💯
- Research, research, and still more research.
- Solving all those research problems with computational skills.
- My PhD in the nearest future.
- Machine learning and omics data analysis.
- My back-end skills in django.
- How to get married with Computational biology one day 💏💍.
- 📫 you can reach me at aniigodwinn@gmail.com
- and smile, you're beautiful☺.
